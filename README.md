# Code Reviews

This repository is designed to teach students the code review process.  There are several pull requests, PRs, with sample code submissions.

## Overview

Students will review the PRs and add comments to suggest changes and ask questions.  This is designed to give students practice at looking at a pull request, reading code and exercising code review etiquette.  

## How This Will Work

Each student will open 3 PRs in separate tabs in their browser.  The PRs are assigned by table.  They will review the code adding inline comments, questions and suggested changes.  They will **not** submit the review.  Instead, student will wait until all students are finished reviewing the PR.  

Then students will submit their reviews and decide if they accept the PR, or want to request changes.

After students are finished reviewing the PRs each table will discuss their comments.  At the end the class will discuss as a whole any comments or open questions each table had.
