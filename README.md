# Code Reviews

## Overview

This repository is designed to teach students the code review process.  There are several pull requests, PRs, with sample code submissions.  Students will practice reviewing these submissions and then discuss their comments for clarity, etiquette and correctness.

## How This Will Work

### Reviewing PRs

Each student will open 3 PRs in separate tabs in their browser.  The PRs are assigned by table.  They will review the code adding inline comments, questions and suggested changes.  They will **not** submit the review.  Instead, student will wait until all students are finished reviewing the PR.  

Then students will submit their reviews and decide if they accept the PR, or want to request changes.

Students are asked to look for:

* Do I understand what this code is doing? (Readability)
* Are there things wrong with this code? (Correctness)
* Are there changes (Improvements) I can suggest to make the code more:
  * Readable
  * Efficient
  * Flexible

### Reviewing Code Reviews

After students are finished reviewing the PRs each table will examine the code comments and discuss.

As students review comments they are asked:

* Is this comment correct?
* Does the comment clearly communicate the point?
* Is the comment kind and collaborative?

### Wrap Up

At the end of the lesson the class will discuss group observations and unanswered questions.
